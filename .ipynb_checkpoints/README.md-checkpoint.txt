# 🎶 Music Genre Classifier: An End-to-End Data Science Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify 30-second audio clips into one of ten music genres. This is an end-to-end portfolio piece showcasing skills in signal processing, feature engineering, classic classification algorithms (KNN), and model evaluation.

## 💡 Methodology

1.  **Data Source:** GTZAN Music Genre Collection.
2.  **Signal Processing:** Use the `librosa` library to extract features like MFCCs and Chroma.
3.  **Model:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
4.  **Evaluation:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.
